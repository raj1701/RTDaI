# RTDaI

### Description
The inspiration of our idea comes from the previous online semester. One of the biggest disadvantages of online mode is that it cannot provide a traditional offline classroom experience . Students cannot have discussions with each other which we feel is essential for any learning. \
We are planning to create an application where teachers and students can collaborate and engage in discussions of small groups . Teacher will have admin privileges. Teacher can allow students to start discussing in groups, with students being connected in the whole class meet simultaneously. Each group can ask doubts where Teacher(or many TAs) will solve their doubts in a FCFS manner. All the meet processes will be automated by us. Everything will happen at the click of a button thereby leading to ease of use . The end product would be something that replicates the ambience and feel of a traditional offline classroom and our approach will be in accordance with this goal in mind.
### Tech Stack Used
Firebase \
React-js \
jitsi-meet\
### Libraries and dependencies
Jutsu-api

### Installation Steps
npm install \
npm install firebase firebase-auth react-jutsu react-bootstrap lib-jitsi-meet --force react-router-dom

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
